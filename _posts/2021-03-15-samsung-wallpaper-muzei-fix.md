A quick blog, but one that I keep forgetting how to do because it takes me at least 10 minutes to rediscover it and figure out how to do it again, but it happens infrequently enough where it's something I had hoped I'd remember. After 3 times, it's time to write it down!

First off, the problem: Samsung decided it wanted me to see it's garbage lockscreen wallpaper, when all I really want is to use Muzei.

The solution: Go to "My Wallpapers", hit the triple dots, hit Live wallpapers, and from there choose Muzei.

Yep, really simple, but the location of this option and what it's buried under makes no sense.
